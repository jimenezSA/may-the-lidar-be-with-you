# â€‹Spaceborne Lidar Applications Trainings and Resources
These trainings and collected resources aim to build participants' capacity to use lidar Earth science technologies for ecosystem service monitoring and management. For a detailed overview, you can read the [concept note](linkhere). After completeing these trainings, participants will gain:
1. A conceptual understanding of lidar sensors and systems compared to other forms of remote sensing.
2. Knowledge of the use and interpretation of said lidar systems for ecosystem applications and areas of research overviewing data types and analysis platforms. 
3. Ability to search, select, acquire lidar data with recommendations for testing and applying data quality processing methods.
4. An overview of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar mission, its theoretical background and product details and future of the mission.
5. Methodological approaches for generating and validating canopy height, biomass, and other structural analyses of ecosystems with field and real-world use examples.

The lesson content for each Module can be found in the tabs on the lefthand side panel. Additionally, you can find information about all the workshop partners under the **Partners** tab, supplementary learning material under the **Resources** tab, and photos from the workshops (and a place to upload your own photos) under the **Photos** tab.
